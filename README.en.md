# Adguard Home For Android
<a href="https://deepwiki.com/liuzq2002/Adguard-Home-For-Magisk-Mod"><img src="https://deepwiki.com/badge.svg" alt="Ask DeepWiki"></a>

[简体中文](README.md) | **English** 
- Ad blocking via DNS request redirection/filtering is universal across modular Root managers
- This project is permanently open-source and free without donations or its variants, and does not differentiate versions based on whether a donation is made
- It achieves out-of-the-box ease of use; after flashing the module, you can use it by just following the tutorial for minor troubleshooting (no need to configure rules)
- Built-in GOODBYEADS blocking rules and adds custom rules on top of them
- This project aims to replace traditional Hosts and deliver a better modern experience — with 'zero' ad leakage, high performance, and strong stealth

## ⚠️ Risk Notice – Please Read
- Users who have updated to version 2026.03.01 must not downgrade to an earlier version, as doing so may leave residual files when uninstalling modules.
- May interfere with coupon redemption functionality in some apps (not a false positive)
- May prevent reward systems based on watching ads (not a false positive)
- Do **not** use with other similar ad-blocking modules
- Cannot block ads served from the same domain as content (e.g., Twitch, YouTube, Instagram)

## 🔧 DNS-only Mode (default)
- Enabled by default: only the AdGuard Home process and ProxyConfig.sh local DNS injection run. iptables.sh / NoAdsService.sh / ModuleMOD.sh are not started or maintained, and no iptables/ip6tables changes are made.
- TUN-based proxies such as YumeBox keep their own TUN routing; ports 53/853 are not hijacked by this module.
- The admin port is fixed at `http://127.0.0.1:31423`; open `http://127.0.0.1:31423/#dns` to change the mode directly.
- How to switch: go to AdGuard Home “DNS settings -> Blocked domains”:
  - Keep `dns-only` = DNS-only mode (default)
  - Remove `dns-only` = full mode (starts iptables.sh / NoAdsService.sh / ModuleMOD.sh)
- Reboot after changing for it to take effect.

## 💡 Advantages Over Other Solutions
### What are the advantages compared to non-AdguardHome DNS implementation solutions?
1. AdguardHome despite years of maintenance still has high-risk CVE vulnerabilities; other competing solutions would only be worse (as their technical strength is not as profound as that of Adguard company)
2. In terms of performance and power consumption they may not be better than AdguardHome which is written in Go language; the smaller the project, the fewer people monitor it and the less likely it is to discover deep-seated vulnerabilities (especially since AdguardHome is a globally renowned open-source large project)
### vs. Private DNS
1. No server dependency → no downtime or overload issues
2. Lower latency – processing happens locally
3. Better privacy – no data sent to third-party servers
### vs. Hosts File
1. Encrypted DNS (DoH) support
2. Prevents DNS hijacking
3. Harder to detect and block, Because the loopback address returned by Hosts is itself a detectable signature
4. No need to flash the meta module, achieving even better concealment
### vs. Accessibility-based Ad Skippers (e.g., Li Tiao Tiao)
1. No background process killing issues
2. No UI lag or performance drain
3. Lightweight and battery-efficient
4. No package name detection risks
### vs. LSPosed Modules
1. Less detectable – no app hooking or injection
2. Broader coverage – blocks ads system-wide, not per-app
### Compared to a VPN, what are the advantages of ad blocking?
1. No need to worry about apps detecting that a VPN is active
2. No need to worry about disconnections in the background
## 📖 Tutorial – Read Before Use
- Disable or uninstall other ad-blocking modules, proxy tools, accessibility services, VPN ad blockers, browser ad blockers etc
- If the ad cannot be blocked, clear all data for the app and try again.
- Magisk users: Click the gear icon next to the module to access the Web UI manager
- If using Clash Meta, disable system proxy in Network settings (tested and working)
